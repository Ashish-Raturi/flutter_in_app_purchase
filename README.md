Adding **In App Purchase** to a **Flutter app** requires correctly setting up the App and Play stores, verifying the purchase, and granting the necessary permissions.

In this course, you'll add **two types of In App Purchase** to an app and verify these purchases using **Firebase.**

The first purchase, **"Get Premium"** gives users premium access. This only has to be purchased once and is available forever. Such a purchase is non-consumable because the app cannot consume it but is valid forever.

The second option, **"Get Game Coin"** gives the user a direct benefit of **10 Gold Coins.** These are directly available to the user and can be bought many times. This is called a consumable as it is directly consumed and can be consumed multiple times.

The backend service (provided for you) verifies the purchases using **Cloud Functions and Firestore.** Using Firebase makes the process easier, and in your production app, you can use this backend service. It's **EASY | SECURE | RECOMMEND FOR PRODUCTION APP.**
